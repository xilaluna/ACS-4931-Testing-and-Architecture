  - Study the file [introduce_explaining_variable3.py](introduce_explaining_variable3.py). Use `Replace Temp with query` technique to improve readability of the code.

- [x] Exercise 5: 'Extract Function' Technique

  - Study the file '[distance_between_two_points.py](distance_between_two_points.py). Use `extract function` technique to improve modularity of the code.
